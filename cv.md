## About me:
After a few years of working as an e-commerce manager, where I was kind of all-in-one (designer, copywriter, marketer, technical specialist), I realized that I like to solve technical problems related to design creation and e-marketplace integration software more than other kind of tasks. Thus, I concluded that I wanted to do some technical stuff in my life, chose Web Development, and began to study everything that was directly related to this area. While studying Web Development, I realized that this type of work is fascinating and it suits me very well: I love solving various kinds of problems, and my perseverance and patience allow me to get to the very essence of the problem being solved and find a solution, even if it takes a long time. In addition, I enjoy learning and self-studying, and I believe that programming is one of those areas in which education is an endless process.
